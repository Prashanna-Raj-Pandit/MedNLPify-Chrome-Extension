# MedNLPify-Chrome-Extension
MedNLPify is a Chrome extension and NLP tool that simplifies the language of medical research abstracts to make them
more readable and accessible to non-experts and medical practitioners alike. It replicates and builds on the approach 
introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251">PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts</a>, 
using a trained NLP model to tag and classify sentences in medical abstracts.
