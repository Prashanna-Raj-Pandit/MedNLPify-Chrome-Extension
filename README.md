# MedNLPify-Chrome-Extension
MedNLPify is a Chrome extension and NLP tool that simplifies the language of medical research abstracts to make them
more readable and accessible to non-experts and medical practitioners alike. It replicates and builds on the approach 
introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251">PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts</a>, 
using a trained NLP model to tag and classify sentences in medical abstracts.

 ðŸš€Features
* Classifies sentences in medical abstracts into logical sections (e.g., Background, Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion).

* Enhances readability by helping users understand the structure and flow of research papers.

*  Chrome extension integration for real-time simplification of abstracts on PubMed or similar research databases.

* Powered by NLP and Deep Learning using TensorFlow
